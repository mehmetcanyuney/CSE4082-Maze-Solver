# CSE4082-Maze-Solver
CSE4082 - Artificial Intelligence - Maze Solver

## The project allows you to test given 6 algorithms for selected maze
  - Depth First Search
  - Breath First Search
  - Greedy Best First Search
  - Iterative Deepening Search
  - Uniform Cost Search
  - A-star Search

## Maze file instructions
  - Maze file should be well designed.
  - An example located on `/maze/maze.txt`
    - S => Starting point
    - G => Goal points
    - T => Traps - increases cost of move
      - Normal moves cost 1
      - If land of trap the cost will be 7

## How to run the project
  - Change directory to root of the project
  - Run `python src/__init__.py` with Python3.x
